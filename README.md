# Primer to Machine Learning

This repository is my personal project which is a collection of topics and codes, that I've learnt in the domain of data science and Machine Learning, This repository is planned like a roadmap to ML, and every topic is modelled like a short reference guide.

The tentative list of topics I plan to cover here is as follows:

1. **Statistics for Machine Learning**
2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**
3. **Optimization**
4. **Supervised Learning**
5. **Model Evaluation and Validation**
6. **Unsupervised Learning**
7. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
8. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
9. **Time Series Analysis**
10. **Reinforcement Learning**
