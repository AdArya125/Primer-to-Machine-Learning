    "# 4.2.5 Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces and are particularly well-suited for scenarios where the data is not linearly separable. The key idea behind SVMs is to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space while maximizing the margin between classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs are particularly useful in the following scenarios:\n",
    "- **Classification**: When the classes are well-separated.\n",
    "- **Non-linear data**: SVMs can efficiently perform classification in non-linearly separable cases using kernel tricks, such as polynomial or radial basis function (RBF) kernels.\n",
    "- **High-dimensional data**: SVMs perform well even in high-dimensional spaces, such as text classification and image recognition.\n",
    "- **Outlier detection**: SVMs are effective in identifying outliers, as they focus on the support vectors closest to the decision boundary.\n",
