    "# 4.2.4 Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It operates by aggregating predictions from multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and control overfitting. Here are some key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensemble Method**: Combines multiple decision trees to improve generalizability and robustness over a single tree.\n",
    "- **Randomization**: Each tree in the ensemble is trained on a random subset of the training data (bootstrap sampling) and a random subset of the features (feature bagging).\n",
    "- **Prediction**: For classification tasks, the final prediction is the majority vote of all individual trees. For regression tasks, it's the average prediction of all trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Accuracy**: Random Forests generally provide higher accuracy compared to individual decision trees.\n",
    "- **Reduced Overfitting**: By averaging multiple decision trees, Random Forests reduce overfitting and improve generalization.\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**: Provides an estimate of feature importance, helping to identify which features are most influential in making predictions.\n",
    "- **Robust**: Effective for both classification and regression tasks and handles large datasets with high dimensionality well.\n"
