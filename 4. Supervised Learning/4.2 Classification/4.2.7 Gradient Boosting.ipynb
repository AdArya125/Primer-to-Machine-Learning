    "# 4.2.7 Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is a powerful ensemble learning technique that builds a strong predictive model by sequentially adding weak learners (typically decision trees) to correct errors made by previous models. Key points include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequential Learning**: Models are added sequentially, and each new model corrects errors from its predecessor.\n",
    "- **Gradient Descent**: Gradient Boosting optimizes a loss function by descending gradients, minimizing prediction errors.\n",
    "- **Combining Weak Learners**: Boosting focuses on combining many weak learners to create a strong learner, improving model performance.\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Techniques like shrinkage (learning rate) and tree pruning prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Accuracy**: Gradient Boosting often provides higher accuracy than individual models by leveraging the strengths of multiple weak learners.\n",
    "- **Handles Complex Relationships**: Effective in capturing complex relationships in data without overfitting.\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**: Provides insights into feature importance, aiding in model interpretation.\n",
    "- **Versatility**: Suitable for various types of data and tasks including classification, regression, and ranking.\n",
